The test data in this folder are captured reponses from the public data provided
by the State Government of Victoria's GIS department, using GeoServer:

Victorian Government public data portal:
https://www.data.vic.gov.au/

GeoServer (popular server implementing OpenGIS standards):
http://geoserver.org/

This test data is used by the Unit Test cases of 'opengis-client-kotlin' to verify
error-free unmarshalling of OpenGIS data.

The Victorian State Government data was chosen as a rich set of useful data, served by a popular
GIS server, with the aim of identifying any variances from the opengis-reference data that
may occur in typical real-world usage.
